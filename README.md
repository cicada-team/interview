# Tournament

Tally the results of a small football competition.

Tally the results of a small football competition. Based on an input file
containing which team played against which and what the outcome was
create a file with a table like this:

```
Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P
Devastating Donkeys            |  3 |  2 |  1 |  0 |  7
Allegoric Alaskans             |  3 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  6
Blithering Badgers             |  3 |  1 |  0 |  2 |  3
Courageous Californians        |  3 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  1
```

What do those abbreviations mean?

- MP: Matches Played
- W: Matches Won
- D: Matches Drawn (Tied)
- L: Matches Lost
- P: Points

A win earns a team 3 points. A draw earns 1. A loss earns 0.

The outcome should be ordered by points, descending. In case of a tie, teams are ordered alphabetically.

###

Input

Your tallying program will receive input that looks like:

```
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
Devastating Donkeys;Allegoric Alaskans;win
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
Blithering Badgers;Devastating Donkeys;loss
Allegoric Alaskans;Courageous Californians;win
```

The result of the match refers to the first team listed. So this line

```
Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
```

Means that the Allegoric Alaskans beat the Blithering Badgers.

This line:

```
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
```

Means that the Blithering Badgers beat the Courageous Californians.

And this line:

```
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
```

Means that the Devastating Donkeys and Courageous Californians tied.

Your program should only process input lines that follow this format.
All other lines should be ignored:
If an input contains both valid and invalid input lines,
output a table that contains just the results from the valid lines.

### Answer:

#### Class:

```javascript
class Matches {
	
	constructor() {
		this.teams = {}
	}

	static initTeam(team) {
		team = team || {}
		team.mp = team.mp || 0 // 场次
		team.w = team.w || 0 // win
		team.d = team.d || 0 // draw
		team.l = team.l || 0 // loss
		team.p = team.p || 0 // points
		return team
	}

	add(desc) {
		const [a, b, type] = desc.split(';')
		this.teams[a] = Matches.initTeam(this.teams[a])
		this.teams[b] = Matches.initTeam(this.teams[b])
		this.teams[a]['mp'] ++
		this.teams[b]['mp'] ++
		switch(type) {
			case 'win':
				this.teams[a]['w'] ++
				this.teams[b]['l'] ++
				this.teams[a]['p'] = this.teams[a]['p'] + 3
						break
			case 'loss':
				this.teams[b]['w'] ++
				this.teams[a]['l'] ++
				this.teams[b]['p'] = this.teams[b]['p'] + 3
						break
			case 'draw':
				this.teams[a]['d'] ++
				this.teams[b]['d'] ++
				this.teams[a]['p'] ++
				this.teams[b]['p'] ++
						break
				default:
					break;
		}
	}

	adds(descs) {
		descs.split('\n').forEach(desc => {
			this.add(desc)
		})
	}

	get info() {
		return this.result
	}
}
```

#### Use:

```javascript
const matches = new Matches()

console.log(matches)

matches.adds(`Allegoric Alaskans;Blithering Badgers;win
Devastating Donkeys;Courageous Californians;draw
Devastating Donkeys;Allegoric Alaskans;win
Courageous Californians;Blithering Badgers;loss
Blithering Badgers;Devastating Donkeys;loss
Allegoric Alaskans;Courageous Californians;win`)

console.log(matches.teams)
```

# 2 Ordered Link List

根据输入的数组中每项的 before/after/first/last 规则，输出一个新排好序的数组或者链表。要求，多解的情况可以只求一解，如果无解要求程序能检测出来。

Input:

```
[
    {id: 1},
    {id: 2, before: 1},
    {id: 3, after: 1},
    {id: 5, first: true},
    {id: 6, last: true},
    {id: 7, after: 8},
    {id: 8},
    {id: 9},
]
```

# 3 Create Tree from flat data

将输入的数组组装成一颗树状的数据结构，时间复杂度越小越好。要求程序具有侦测错误输入的能力。

Input:

```
[
    {id:1, name: 'i1'},
    {id:2, name:'i2', parentId: 1},
    {id:4, name:'i4', parentId: 3},
    {id:3, name:'i3', parentId: 2},
    {id:8, name:'i8', parentId: 7}
]
```

# 4 Dominoes

Make a chain of dominoes.

Compute a way to order a given set of dominoes in such a way that they form a
correct domino chain (the dots on one half of a stone match the dots on the
neighbouring half of an adjacent stone) and that dots on the halfs of the stones
which don't have a neighbour (the first and last stone) match each other.

For example given the stones `21`, `23` and `13` you should compute something
like `12 23 31` or `32 21 13` or `13 32 21` etc, where the first and last numbers are the same.

For stones 12, 41 and 23 the resulting chain is not valid: 41 12 23's first and last numbers are not the same. 4 != 3

Some test cases may use duplicate stones in a chain solution, assume that multiple Domino sets are being used.

Input example:
(1, 2), (5, 3), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 4), (5, 6)
